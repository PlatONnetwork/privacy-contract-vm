MIRACL
======
What is MIRACL?
Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library – the MIRACL Crypto SDK – is a C software library that is widely regarded by developers as the gold standard open source SDK for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

Why is it different?
While many other cryptographic SDKs are focused on PC use, MIRACL also enables developers to build security into highly constrained environments, including embedded, mobile apps and SCADA.

<h2>MIRACL enables</h2>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Reduced program code</li>
<li>Greatly simplified program development</li>
<li>Developer-designed APIs</li>
<li>Rapid implementation, using inline code wrappers, example programs and other innovations</li>
</ul>

These unique qualities are the reason MIRACL, and the solutions and services built using it, are in use in hundreds of organizations across the world, including BAE Systems, Hitachi, Intel, Panasonic, Toyota and many others.

<h2>Features and Benefits: why MIRACL is the right choice</h2>
MIRACL delivers a wide and unique range of benefits, enabling developers to secure even the most constrained environments quickly, easily and effectively. It features, amongst others:

<ul type="disc">
<li>An inline C++ wrapper – greatly simplifying program development</li>
<li>Over 25 example programs in C and C++, covering a wide range of applications, to give development a head start</li>
<li>Optimization of both embedded processors and RAM, to help developers overcome device and memory constraints</li>
<li>Compatibility with industry security technologies including AES encryption, RSA public key cryptography, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, DSA digital signature, and others</li>
<li>A set of tools that enable any new number-theoretic technique to be implemented quickly</li>
</ul>

The MIRACL library consists of well over 100 routines that cover all aspects of multi-precision arithmetic. Two new data-types are defined - big for large integers and flash (short for floating-slash) for large rational numbers. The large integer routines are based on Knuth’s algorithms, described in Chapter 4 of his classic work ‘The Art of Computer Programming’. Floating-slash arithmetic, which works with rounded fractions, was originally proposed by D. Matula and P. Kornerup. All routines have been thoroughly optimised for speed and efficiency, while at the same time remaining standard, portable C. However optional fast assembly language alternatives for certain time-critical routines are also included, particularly for the popular Intel 80x86 range of processors. A C++ interface is also provided. Full source code is included.

<h2>Bug Tracker</h2>
  CertiVox uses JIRA for bug and feature tracking which is integrated with our development system.   If you find a bug, you should report bugs into the <a href="https://sdlc.certivox.com/browse/MIRACL">CertiVox bug tracker&nbsp;</a>.  You can check that the bug hasn't already been reported by searching for it. If you find the bug already reported, you can add a comment of your own about it, or change its status to &quot;Confirmed&quot;. If the bug hasn't been reported, you can file a new bug report.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
  CertiVox is most of all a community of like-minded information security professionals who believe that cryptography is a necessary tool to advance individual freedom and safeguard privacy. CertiVox acts on that belief by providing tools that can be used to secure information, guard privacy and advance individual freedom.<br />
